# Proposal and Voting Mechanisms

{% hint style="warning" %}
This document is currently subject to public review before being finalized. If you notice a revision that needs to be made or have feedback, please [request a revision](https://github.com/connext/gitbook-docs/issues/new) or start a conversation with us on Discord at [https://discord.gg/connext](https://discord.gg/connext).
{% endhint %}

This is a suggested process for developing and advancing Connext Improvement Proposals. It is a dynamic document intended to be owned, refined, and enforced by the Connext community.

1. [**Connext Forum**](https://forum.connext.network/)**:**\
   Forum is used for governance-related discussions. Community members must register for an account before sharing or liking posts.
2. **Snapshot:**\
   Snapshot is a voting interface used for delegating votes, and creating and voting on proposals.
3. **Crosschain Governance:**\
   In line with the Connext DAO vision to empower builders to create applications that are universally accessible **from any chain, using any token,** Connext supports voting and delegation across multiple chains as well as cross-chain proposal execution.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: In conjunction with the Zodiac team, Connext and DeFi Wonderland have created a cross-chain widget that plugs into SAFEs to facilitate proposal execution. This tooling allows users to generate cross-chain payload directly from their SAFE. \
\
More information about the Zodiac Connext module is available [**here**](https://blog.connext.network/crosschain-governance-a-new-integration-connext-x-zodiac-gnosis-guild-5cf119a6cf2e).
